  title: Metahkg Api
  description: "# Introduction

    The Metahkg Api is a REST api written in fastify/typescript, with MongoDB as the database.
    <br>
    Json is returned on every request.
    <br>
    In this documentation, the base url is /api.

    # Authentication

    Authentication is done with a JWT token, which is sent to the server as a header.
    <br><br>
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
    ```
    <br><br>
    The JWT token is returned on login (/users/login) and verify email (/users/verify).
    <br>
    It is valid for 7 days.
    <br>
    If the JWT token is at least 2 days old, or some of the user info (e.g. user name) has changed, a new token
    is returned via the `token` response header on any requests.
    <br><br>
    ```
    token: <JWT>
    ```
    <br><br>
    Also see [a frontend implmentation using axios](https://gitlab.com/metahkg/metahkg-web/-/blob/master/src/lib/api.ts).

    # Metahkg api client

    The client is generated from this specification.
